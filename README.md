## Objective
To work in an AGILE environment in a team of 5 to create a Web Application from start to finish. This involved the planning stage (e.g. user testing), development stage (e.g. JavaScript, React.js, Netlify) and presentation (formal presentation, judged by a panel of employees from industry). During this 'hackathon' style event, my team was exposed to various different technologies (Bootstrap, React.js and Netlify), methods of working in a team (in this case, following the AGILE methodology; 1-2 hour Sprints) and preparing a formal presentation to a panel of employees followed by a Q&A.<br/>

Our final product was Cheapies; a platform which utilised TradeMe's API. This platform allowed users to compare retail prices with TradeMe auctions. The end goal was to allow users to make informed decisions about whether they wanted to spend large sums on a new item or compromise by buying used, resulting in saved funds.

## Achievements
✅ Successfully worked in a team to create and deploy a web application.<br/>
